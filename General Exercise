Question-3 Why does the alert show "Jack" first and then undefined?
function identity() {
    var name = 'Jack';
    alert(name);
    return
    name
};

var who = identity();
alert(who)


Answer- first alert will show "Jack" beacause first compiler will go to variable who where it will get the identity function so it will run the function and show the "Jack"
then it will go to last line alert(who), where it will show undefined. because javascript is a single thread.
